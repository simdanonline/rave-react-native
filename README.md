## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rave Public And Encryption Keys](https://rave.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)


## Installations

> To use rave react native SDK in your application, you need to have `Node` and `npm` downloaded and installed on your machine.

- [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install `Node` to your machine. `npm` is always automatically installed when you install `Node`.

- To ensure you have `Node` and `npm` installed, enter the following command into your terminal/command prompt: `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively.

- To run `react native` on your machine you can use `npm install -g expo-cli` to install [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/) a command line utility to get you started quickly or use this command `npm install -g react-native-cli` to install the [react native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

## Deployment

> To Implement Rave By Flutterwave easily with React Native

- You can get your Public, Secret and your Encryption Keys on your account by clicking this link >>> [Flutterwave Rave Live](https://rave.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis).

- To get your **`TEST`** public, secret and encryption keys click on the `Live Mode` Toggle button to switch to Test account and `Test Mode` Toggle button to switch to live.

- This is shown in the screenshots displayed below.

## How It Works

This is a simple demonstration of how to set up a simple react native app and integrate `rave react native SDK` into it.

Using the [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/) command line utility, enter the following command to get started:

  - `expo init AwesomeProject`
  - `cd AwesomeProject`
  - `npm start`

- You should get this from your terminal:

</p>

- Install the Expo client or mobile application from [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) or [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www)

- Open the Expo client app you installed on your mobile phone, then scan the barcode displaying on the terminal on your PC.

- If successfully scanned and built, your app should load up on your mobile phone with the result in the image below;

## Payment Options

### The payment options include:
- Card Payments
- Account Payments
- Mpesa 
- Ghana Mobile Money Payments
- Uganda Mobile Money Payments
- Zambia Mobile Money Payments
- Rwanda Mobile Money Payments
- USSD Payments


## Usage


### Payments

#### 1.  import Rave Component 

```javascript
import Rave from '@simdanonline/react-native-rave';
```

#### 2. Set your success, failure and close methods

```javascript
 constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.onSuccess = this.onSuccess.bind(this);
    this.onFailure = this.onFailure.bind(this);
    this.onClose = this.onClose.bind(this);
  }

  onSuccess(data) {
    console.log("success", data);
    // You can get the transaction reference from successful transaction charge response returned and handle your transaction verification here

  }

  onFailure(data) {
    console.log("error", data);
  }

  onClose() {
    //navigate to the desired screen on rave close

  }
```

#### 3. Use component (ensure to set currency for the desired payment method to display)

`Note:` Rave allows merchants can also set paymentOption to account, in order to accept only the Account payment methods. 

`Note:` Leaving paymentOption empty sets the default payment method to card only.

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <Rave 
        amount="500" 
        country="NG" 
        currency="NGN" 
        paymentOption="card,account"
        email="test@mail.com" 
        firstname="Oluwole" 
        lastname="Adebiyi" 
        publickey="FLWPUBK-**************************-X" 
        encryptionkey="****************"
        meta={[{ metaname: "color", metavalue: "red" }, { metaname: "storelocation", metavalue: "ikeja" }]}
        onSuccess={res => this.onSuccess(res)} 
        onFailure={e => this.onFailure(e)}
        onClose={e => this.onClose(e)}
        />
  );
}
```

### Mpesa

`Note:` Rave allows merchants to set payment method to Mpesa only by setting paymentOption to mpsesa, only the mpesa payment option would be available. Merchants can also set paymentOption to card,mpsesa in order to accept both card and Mpsesa as payment methods. 

`Note:` Leaving paymentOption empty sets the default payment method to card only.

    this.onFailure = this.onFailure.bind(this);
    this.onClose = this.onClose.bind(this);
  }

  onSuccess(data) {
    console.log("success", data);
    // You can get the transaction reference from successful transaction charge response returned and handle your transaction verification here

  }

  onFailure(data) {
    console.log("error", data);
  }

  onClose() {
    //navigate to the desired screen on rave close

## Sample Transaction Verification Method Using Nodejs BackEnd

### `NOTE:` For best practices, it is always advisable to verify transactions to be sure the response data returned corresponds with what was initially passed and also to get the full data of a transaction.

### Below shows sample code on how this can be done using Nodejs Backend

#### Prerequisites

- `express`
- `body-parser`
- `request`

#### How it works

- Create your backend project directory
- From inside your backend project directory, open your terminal and run `npm init` to create your `package.json` file.
- Install the packages above `npm install express --save`, `npm install body-parser --save` and `npm install request --save`.
- Create your `index.js` file and copy the code snippet below to set this up.

```node
var express = require("express");
var bodyParser = require("body-parser");
var app = express();
var request = require("request");
var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;


app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: false
}))
app.use(bodyParser.json())


app.post('/api', function(req, res){
    console.log(req.body.txref);
    request.post(
        {
            url:'https://ravesandboxapi.flutterwave.com/flwv3-pug/getpaidx/api/v2/verify',
            json: {
            txref:req.body.txref, // This is the transaction you get from your react native app
            SECKEY: "PASS-YOUR-RAVE-SECRET-HERE"
                },
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        },
      function(error, response, body){
        if (error) {
            return console.error('Error Occurred:', error);
        }
        console.log(response.statusCode);
        console.log(body);
        res.send(body);
      });
});

app.listen(port, err => {
    if(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }else {
        console.log('App listening on port %s', port);
    }
})
```

- Save the file above. Run `node index.js` command from your terminal to serve your verify api. You should now see `App listening on port 3000` on your terminal which means your app is running to receive data from your react native app.

- Now you can go back to your react native app directory and create a file where you link this to your app, e.g you can create a directory `constant` and create a file inside it called `api.js`.

- You will need to link the backend verify api with your app on this file `api.js` by adding the code snippet below:
```node
export const fetchResponse = (transRef) => {

    var url = "http://192.168.88.48/api"; // you will need to pass your backend verify api here
    var request = { 
        method : "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "txref": transRef
        }),
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        }
    }
    fetch(url, request) 
    .then(res => console.log('Success:', JSON.stringify(res.json())))
    .catch(error => console.log('Error:', JSON.stringify(error)));
}

```

- Now you can go to react native `App.js` file to pass the transaction reference from the successful charge response to this function `fetchResponse(transRef)`, as shown in the code snippet below.

```node
import React from 'react';
import Rave from 'react-native-rave';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { fetchResponse } from './constants/api';

export default class App extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.onSuccess = this.onSuccess.bind(this);
    this.onFailure = this.onFailure.bind(this);
  }

  onSuccess(data) {
    console.log("success", data);
    if ((typeof data.data) == "object") {
      if((typeof data.data.txRef) != "undefined"){
        fetchResponse(data.data.txRef);
      }else{
        fetchResponse(data.data.tx.txRef);
      }
    }else{
      fetchResponse(data.txRef);
    }
  }

  onFailure(data) {
    console.log("error", data);
  }

    render() {
    return ( <Rave amount = "100"
      country = "NG"
      currency = "NGN"
      email = "dodez@xgmailoo.com"
      firstname = "Oluwole"
      lastname = "Adebiyi"
      publickey = "FLWPUBK-*********************************-X"
      encryptionkey = "**********************"
      paymenttype = "card"
      meta = {
        [{
          metaname: "color",
          metavalue: "red"
        }, {
          metaname: "storelocation",
          metavalue: "ikeja"
        }]
      }
      onSuccess = {
        res => this.onSuccess(res)
      }
      onFailure = {
        e => this.onFailure(e)
      }
      />
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

- The above steps and code sample just shows and explains how you can handle this with nodejs backend. Please note that you can implement this with any backend language of your choice.

## Setting Up a Simple Webhook with NodeJs and ngrok to receive Rave Webhook request

#### `Note:` You might need to set up a webhook for all your transactions but mostly for mpesa and ghana mobile money to receive webhook request from Rave to verify transactions that occurs on your mobile application.

- Ensure you have `node` and `npm`, if not [refer to this for guide](#installation).
- Next register and download `ngrok` [here](https://ngrok.com/download).
- Extract the downloaded `ngrok` zip file.
- Set your extracted ngrok file to be globally available i.e set it to the environment variable by following these steps:
  - For Windows Users - On the search box on the taskbar of your desktop, search for System (control panel).
  - Click the advanced settings and then click on the environment settings, like this:

  </p>

  - Next copy the ngrok file path and add it to the enviroment variable by selecting the path option and clicking on the edit option like this:

  </p>

- For MacOS users, to have ngrok up and running on your machine, follow the process:
  - Download `ngrok` [here](https://ngrok.com/download)
  - Extract/Unzip it to your Applications directory
  - Create a symlink to ngrok with these commands from your terminal:
    -  cd into your local bin directory

        `cd /usr/local/bin`
    - create symlink
    
    `ln -s /project/ngrok ngrok`
    - now cd into your project directory and reference it like this from your terminal
    - /project/ngrok `[your-port-number]`

- To ensure this is successfully done, enter the command `ngrok -v` in your Terminal. It should return the version of ngrok you are currently running.

- Next create a new project directory, change directory into it and create a new project file like this:

  - `mkdir test-webhook`
  - `cd test-webhook`
  - `touch app.js`
- Next run `npm init` command to initialize your package.json file
- From your project directory install the following `npm` dependencies:

  - `npm install body-parser --save`
  - `npm install express --save`
  - `npm install express-winston --save`
  - `npm install winson --save`
  - `npm install -g nodemon` - an npm package for debugging node applications.

  Or Simply: `npm install body-parser express express-winston winston --save`

  </p>


- Next, we add the following code into our `app.js` file.

```

'use strict';

var express = require('express'); // required to create http server

var bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // required to parse incoming request bodies

var app = express().use(bodyParser.json()); // creates http server

var winston = require('winston'); // data logger

var expressWinston = require('express-winston'); // required to create middleware that log http requests

expressWinston.requestWhitelist.push('body');

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000 // setting the port the server should listen to

process.env.SECRET_HASH = "your-rave-secret-hash" // making the secret hash you set in your dashboard available to the environment variable

app.set('port', port);


/*

using expressWinston to parse webhook http requests to display in the console 
and also write into a .txt file called combined.log.

*/

app.use(expressWinston.logger({
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.Console({
            json: true,
            colorize: true
        }),
        new winston.transports.File({
            filename: 'combined.log',
            level: 'info'
        })
    ]
}));


//  Set the port the server is listening to 

app.listen(port, () => console.log('Webhook is listening to port: ' + port));

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))


/* 

Set your webhook url that will be listening for webhook requests from rave server.
This is required to receive requests from rave server, verify the data received from the server 
and give your customer value.

*/

app.post("/webhook-url", function (req, res) {
    /* It is a good idea to log all events received. Add code *
     * here to log the signature and body to db or file       */

    // retrieve the signature from the header
    var hash = req.headers["verif-hash"];

    if (!hash) {
        // discard the request,only a post with rave signature header gets our attention 
        res.send({
            status: "error"
        });
        process.exit(0)
        // console.log("no hash sent");
    }

    // Get signature stored as env variable on your server
    const secret_hash = process.env.SECRET_HASH;

    // check if signatures match

    if (hash !== secret_hash) {
        // silently exit, or check that you are passing the write hash on your server.
        res.send({
            status: "error"
        });
        process.exit(0)
        // console.log("has is not equal sent");
    }

    // Retrieve the request's body
    var request_json = req.body;

    // Give value to your customer but don't give any output
    // Remember that this is a call from rave's servers and 
    // Your customer is not seeing the response here at all

    res.send(200);
});

```
- Now let's make our webhook url from our local server available to public on the internet with `ngrok`, we are using this method for this project.
  `Note:` This can also be achieved by making your webhook url available to live cloud services like `heroku`, `AWS`, `netlify` and `so on`.

- First, we need to login to your [`ngrok`](#https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/login) dashboard to get your authorization token, from here:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/flutterwavedeveloper/image/upload/v1540752763/rave-react-native/ngrok-dashboard-auth.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok authorization token">
  </p>

- Then from the terminal change directory into the project directory and run the following command:
  - `ngrok authtoken <your-authorization-token>` 
  - `ngrok http <the-port-number-your-node-app-is-listening-to>`

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/flutterwavedeveloper/image/upload/v1540752763/rave-react-native/ngrok-auth.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok-auth-token">
  </p>

- If successfully setup, your webhook url should be up live with this result: 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/flutterwavedeveloper/image/upload/v1540752764/rave-react-native/ngrok-start.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok-start">
  </p>

- Now we add our webhook url to our rave dashboard here:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/flutterwavedeveloper/image/upload/v1540752764/rave-react-native/rave-webhook-url.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="rave-webhook-url">
  </p>

- Then from the terminal we need to run `nodemon app.js` to start our application and ensure it is listening to the port like this:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/flutterwavedeveloper/image/upload/v1540752764/rave-react-native/nodemon-listening.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="nodemon listening">
  </p>
- Our webhook is now up and running to receive webhook requests from rave.
